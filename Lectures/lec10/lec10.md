# Lec10 AWS Aurora

The evolution of AWS storage service is interesting.

The DB transaction tutorial is helpful. Basic knowledge of transaction, in-memory cache, WAL, redo&undo.

Two big ideas in Aurora:

- Quorum for fault-tolerance without too much waiting
- Send log records instead of disk pages!

The parallel, fast recovery of storage node is impressive.

This paper is much harder to read than previous papers. The lecture video and note are very helpful. The FAQ explains the word "offload".
